Assignment 1ï¼š

Multi-queue simulation
      Description: a transmission system subject to 3 inputs and only one server. All inputs are characterized by Poisson process and the service time follows an exponential distribution.

      Goal: explore a scheduling scheme which is able to allocate the service fairly to each of the input in terms of any performance measurement; obtaining the mean queue length, mean waiting time, queue length distribution and waiting time distribution for each queue. Any necessary explaination and statement should be included in the report.

Assignment 2:

    A simulation on channel contending servcie in wireless enviorment. Assuming that 5 stations contends for servcie subject to 802.11 protocol stack. You are required to emulate a 802.11 likely strategy which may lower down the collisions in the network.

    Goals: obtaining the queue length and waiting time distribution of each station; measuring the collision probability for each station; evaluating the throughput of the whole network.
